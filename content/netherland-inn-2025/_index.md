description: Members of the Kingsport Amateur Radio Club operated special event station N4I from the Historic Netherland Inn in Kingsport, Tennessee — a site rich in early American history along the Holston River. Two stations were set up behind the inn, operating on 20 and 40 meters throughout the day. Visitors stopped by to learn about amateur radio, operate under supervision, and enjoy fellowship with local hams. It was a beautiful day of radio, history, and community outreach in the heart of Kingsport’s Boatyard Park.
